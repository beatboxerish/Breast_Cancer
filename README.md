# Breast_Cancer
This contains my first kaggle data science problem. 
The info about this dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data.

Our goal is to predict whether the breast cancer is malignant or benign using the information given by studying the FNA of a breast tumour.

Some problem introduction to give you an idea : 
Our data comes from a Fine Needle Aspiration(FNA) which was performed on the breast mass. Features in our data are as noted in the image of the cell nuclei present in this sample.
A biopsy is a procedure which involves removal of tissues and studying them to identify cancer or the severity/extent of any disease. FNA is just a type of biopsy.
