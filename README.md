# Breast_Cancer
 
This is the first Kaggle problem I worked on.
Our goal in this is to predict whether the breast cancer is malignant or
benign using the information given by studying the FNA of a breast tumour.

The info about this dataset is available here:

### Files :

* Breast Cancer.ipynb : The jupyter nb where I have done all my analysis. 
Tried various classification algorithms along with Grid Search and PCA.

* breast_cancer.html : An html page of the entire Jupyter nb for easy 
viewing of code and analysis.

* data.csv : Contains the data for this project.
